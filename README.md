🏠 HouseOfSQL

Welcome to HouseOfSQL — your one-stop destination for real-life SQL interview questions and solutions! 📈

💡 About the Project

SQL is everywhere. Whether you're preparing for an interview, working on a project, or exploring data analysis, SQL plays a vital role. However, we noticed that SQL resources, especially on platforms like LinkedIn, are scattered and repetitive. That’s why we created HouseOfSQL — an open-source repository designed to:

🔧 Consolidate High-Quality SQL Content: Gather and organize SQL questions based on real-life scenarios and interview experiences.

🔄 Categorize Questions by Companies: Maintain a structured spreadsheet of SQL questions, mapped to the companies where they were asked.

🕋 Build a Searchable Frontend: Soon, we’ll launch a website powered by our spreadsheet, allowing users to easily search for SQL questions by company and topic.

🚀 Why Follow Us?
